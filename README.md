# Tanzania Water Project

PREDICTING WATER PUMPS FUNCTIONALITY IN TANZANIA
![]()

Have you ever wonder what it would be to live without a day to day access to clean water? Well,  I can tell you it would be a huge problem with very serious implications for your survivalâ€¦
We can say that the lack of access to water is one of the biggest problems in the world.

According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the water crisis is the #5 global risk in terms of impact on society and it is a health, education, economic, and gender equity crisis. 
For my mid-project in the Data Analyst Bootcamp at Ironhack I decided to work on finding possible solutions that can contribute to solving the problem of the lack of access to safe water.

### Background

Tanzania is home to one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, but also is one of the many nations around the world that suffers from serious water supply problems. 
To combat this water crisis, in the last years water pumps have been installed all over the country to provide clean water to the people.
Despite years of effort and large amounts of funding the water problem remains in the country.

Installing water pumps is the first step but it is not the solution to the water access problem. They must work properly

### Data

The data for this project was obtained through the Driven Data website. 
It comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water.
The Tanzanian Ministry of Water is involved and working hard to gives a solution to the water crisis in Tanzania. 
They have kept detailed data on close to 60,000 of those water pumps that have been installed in the country 
(40 variables  describing the characteristics and situation of each water pump)

### Workflow

First thing, I analyzed the data to extract insights and detect the variables that make a waterpoint more likely to be non-functional.

After, I worked on data cleaning and preprocessing  to create  a classification machine learning  model that can predict if a water pump is  functional, non-functional, or in need of repairing

Finally, I used feature importance techniques for assigning scores to features used in our predictive model. This indicates the relative importance of each feature when predicting so we can better understand the data ( providing insights into the dataset) and the model. 

### Key Takeaways

I build a Random Forest model that can predict the functionality of the water points with a 79% of precision and 64 % accuracy of a correct prediction of the minority class (recall).
This predictive model will allow us to schedule and improve the cost-effectiveness of maintenance operations of the waterpoints.

I also obtained valuable insights from the data that detects potential causes for water pumps malfunctioning to achieve future improvements.
